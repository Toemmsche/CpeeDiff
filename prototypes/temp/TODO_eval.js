//TODO feat
//      eval file size, run time, space complexity
//      verify that old model machtes new model after diff
//      eval match cases with your own implementation of their algorithm
//      eval unixdiff, XYDiff, RWS-diff (if you want yourself to look bad), LaDiff and MH DIFF (?) with preprocessed document (no description, null nodes, etc)
//      comparison counters and running time framework
//      eval edit distance
//      decompose by stage (mapping vs edit script generation vs merging etc)
//      run profiler and write tests
//      confidence level for merging
//      problem classes
//      use multiple expected to evaluate merging accuracy
