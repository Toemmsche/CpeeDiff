POSSIBLE OPERATIONS:
MOVE/DELETE/INSERT LEAF NODE
MOVE/DELETE/INSERT SUBTREE (complete)
RELABEL NODE

to Include in thesis:
Matching criteria
Change model (operations)
Steps of the algorithm
Function (procedure) definitions and pseudocode
empirical analysis
comparison to other algorithms / tools
Proofs (or references to proofs)
runtime analysis
Contribution
Goals
Overview over existing diff algorithms and appraoches (runtime, limitations, goals)
limitations of the chosen appraoch
Future work
Why you chose a certain algorithm (demonstrate why others didnt work)
why you chose a certain comparison method
serialization/deserilization procedure/relations
property subtree/comparison of leafs only

examples for grouped conflicts reshuffle, chained moves, no comparison for empty variable sets
