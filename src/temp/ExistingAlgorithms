Caveats:

XCC Diff:
- Updates only on nodes with matching attributes, otherwise insertion and deletion => look at paper (how is hash computed?)

XyDiff:
- updates disguised as insertions/deletions if text content was empty

Delta.js:
- updates disguised as insertions/deletions if text content was empty
- moves are not marked, just use XCC for evaluation
