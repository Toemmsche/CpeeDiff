POSSIBLE OPERATIONS:
MOVE/DELETE/INSERT LEAF NODE
MOVE/DELETE/INSERT SUBTREE (complete)
RELABEL NODE

to Include in thesis:
Matching criteria
Change tree (operations)
Steps of the algorithm
Function (procedure) definitions and pseudocode
empirical analysis
merge rules
merge conflicts
merge algorithm
comparison to other algorithms / tools
Proofs (or references to proofs)
runtime analysis
Contribution
Goals
Overview over existing diff algorithms and appraoches (runtime, limitations, goals)
limitations of the chosen appraoch
implementation overview
usage and access (github, CLI)
Future work
Why you chose a certain algorithm (demonstrate why others didnt work)
why you chose a certain comparison method
serialization/deserilization procedure/relations
property subtree/comparison of leafs only

examples for grouped conflicts reshuffle, chained moves, no comparison for empty variable sets
