//TODO feat
//      eval unixdiff, XYDiff, RWS-diff (if you want yourself to look bad), LaDiff and MH DIFF (?) with preprocessed document (no description, null nodes, etc)
//      decompose by stage (mapping vs edit script generation vs merging etc)
//      run profiler and write tests
//      problem export classes
//      fix algorithm names
//        check change model of evaluated diffs, map it to your operations (update and move esp), move as attribute (what about copy?)!
//          impossible for XCC, Deltajs, XyDiff
//      increasing number of changes with different parameters (maxVars, size, totalChanges, distribution, etc.)
//      evaluate robustness
//      class for generated tests
//      flat and deep genearted cases
//      cost is not correct see shuffled only
//      node distribution as genparam
//      rewrite tests, remove data elements and property wrapper, use manipulates instead of cals (where sinnvoll)
//      maybe do not use preprocessed trees for evaluation
//      rename info.json
//      rm -f
//      add tree size in bytes
//      Find out how deltajs indicates moves and updates on nod eattributes,,,way to difficulat to decode yourself
