//TODO feat
//      eval match cases with your own implementation of their algorithm
//      eval unixdiff, XYDiff, RWS-diff (if you want yourself to look bad), LaDiff and MH DIFF (?) with preprocessed document (no description, null nodes, etc)
//      eval edit distance
//      decompose by stage (mapping vs edit script generation vs merging etc)
//      run profiler and write tests
//      confidence level for merging
//      problem export classes
//      further reduce duplicate code amond evaluator
//      TestCase as class and parameter
//      timeout to our algorithms
//      verify algo change detection
//      separarated diff-accuracy cases from diff-performance cases
//      fix algorithm names
