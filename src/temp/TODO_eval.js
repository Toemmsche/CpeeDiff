//TODO feat
//      eval unixdiff, XYDiff, RWS-diff (if you want yourself to look bad), LaDiff and MH DIFF (?) with preprocessed document (no description, null nodes, etc)
//      eval edit distance
//      decompose by stage (mapping vs edit script generation vs merging etc)
//      run profiler and write tests
//      confidence level for merging
//      problem export classes
//      further reduce duplicate code amond evaluator => Directory Scraper and domhelper
//      verify algo change detection
//      separarated diff-accuracy cases from diff-performance cases
//      fix algorithm names
//        check change model of evaluated diffs, map it to your operations (update and move esp), move as attribute (what about copy?)!
//          impossible for XCC, Deltajs, XyDiff
//      add match evaluation for 3DM
//      increasing number of changes with different parameters (maxVars, size, numChanges, distribution, etc.)
//      evaluate robustness
//      class for generated tests
//      use cmd line for merge
//      configurable merge filenames
//      flat and deep genearted cases
//      cost is not correct see shuffled only
//      node distribution as genparam
//      rewrite tests, remove data elements and property wrapper, use manipulates instead of cals (where sinnvoll)
//      maybe do not use preprocessed trees for evaluation
//      rename info.json
//      migrate to testcase architecture in merge and match eval
