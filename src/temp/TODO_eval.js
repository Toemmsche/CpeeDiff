//TODO feat
//      eval unixdiff, XYDiff, RWS-diff (if you want yourself to look bad), LaDiff and MH DIFF (?) with preprocessed document (no description, null nodes, etc)
//      decompose by stage (mapping vs edit script generation vs merging etc)
//      run profiler and write tests
//      problem export classes
//      evaluate robustness
//      flat and deep genearted cases
//      node distribution as genparam
//      rewrite tests, remove data elements and property wrapper, use manipulates instead of cals (where sinnvoll)
//      maybe do not use preprocessed trees for evaluation
//      rename info.json
//      add tree size in bytes
//      Find out how deltajs indicates moves and updates on nod eattributes,way to difficulat to decode yourself
//      comparison of different versions of cpeediff (ultra-fast (hash only), fast(no commonality matching), slow (commonality mastching))
//      xmldom goes crazy for 1000+ nodes???
